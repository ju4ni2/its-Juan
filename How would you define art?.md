   **How would you define art?**

Many people have their own opinion on what art really is and what it should look like. But what is art really? You can think *"The Mona Lisa"* is a peice of art or a painting by Picasso is art but art is more than a painting, art is a work that can get you thinking or get you on your "fellings". 
   
   Over the years the perspective of what is art has changed. From being just paint in a piece of paper to being buildings, pictures in the nature, or sculptures. But everyone has different perspectives, for me there are some works that I do not like. For example I don't like paintins that has little color because I feel the atist is not expresing himself and/or did not have a plan on what the painying will be before he started. I also do not like painting ofsomething that does not move, like the painting of the sunflowr vase, I don't like those type of paintings.
    
   For me art is more than just panting, it should express felling, show life and colors and a lot but a lot of movement. I really like structures that show art, specially at parks. I also like art that have to do with sports becuse thats what I like.
